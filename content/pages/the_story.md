Title: The Story
Image: the_story.png

Back in 2012, infuriated by the woeful software available for the Tacx Bushido, two brothers set about building their own. After figuring out the protocol required to control the trainer, writing an ANT+ library for Java, and forking Google MyTracks Cyclismo was born. 5 years later we've just added ANT FEC support, opening up Cyclismo to a whole range of different trainers.  There's still a lot of work to be done, but by releasing everything as free and open-source software you can help too. Be it, testing, bug reports, feature requests or pull requests we welcome your contribution. Let's build the best cycling simulator possible, let's do it together and let's keep it free!
