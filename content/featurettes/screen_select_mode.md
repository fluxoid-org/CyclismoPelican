Want to simulate a previous ride, or one you created? Choose *simulation*. 

You'd rather space out and train at a % of your FTP? Choose *constant power*. Cyclismo will use a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller to automatically adjust the trainer resistance to meet your target. Don't like the PID controller? We have other feedback mechanisms too, we just haven't exposed them in the GUI yet.

We're not sure why you'd choose constant speed, but it's there if you need it.
